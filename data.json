served to check in on how Ariana Madix and her orbit were faring in the wake of Scandoval, this week’s is about introducing us to the cold war that she and Tom Sandoval are still fighting. They’re still sharing their Valley Village house, and while this apparently isn’t much of an issue while Tom is off filming his other various reality shows, it’s less than ideal when they both try to live there. Ariana is only willing to communicate with him via his assistant, the coincidentally named Ann Maddox, a woman whose visible anxiety on screen is only slightly less than Milicent, the character who replaced Ashley Tisdale on The Suite Life Of Zack And Cody when she got too famous.\n\nAnyway, it’s Sandoval’s birthday, and he wants to have a party at the house. He offers to put Ariana up in a hotel for the night if she doesn’t want to be there. She flatly refuses and tells Tom (via Ann) that if he tries to have a party in their house she will call the police. She tells us in a confessional that she used to dread Tom’s parties, which could go until 6 in the morning, and now she doesn’t have to pretend to be okay with it anymore. That’s fair, but calling the cops is a little ridiculous, and every other cast member who gets to voice an opinion about it agrees.\n\nWe talked to Scheana Shay and Raquel Leviss right before all this Vanderpump Rules stuff broke\nWe've reached the Instagram notes app apology/threatening legal action phase of Vanderpump Rules' 'Scandoval'\nLala Kent continues her two-episode streak of having mostly astute observations and tells Ariana that the more she lashes out at Tom’s slights, the more slights he’s going to commit because he enjoys messing with her. Tom also does legitimately own half the house (and claims later in the episode to have paid all the bills for eight months amid the scandal) so his desire to have a birthday party in it isn’t totally unfounded; Ariana doesn’t want to move out because she thinks it would make Tom’s life too easy. Lala offers whatever critiques she can and listens patiently. Later, she’s the best dressed at the Pump closing party. Strong episode for Lala, overall!\n\nBut yes, Pump, Lisa Vanderpump’s explicitly gay bar, closed this episode. It was strangely a non-event. We were treated to a very earnest montage of Pump moments, like Katie Maloney asking Lisa to officiate her wedding—Katie’s only real moment of the whole episode, sidelining her for the second week in a row. The montage unfortunately does not include DJ James Kennedy screaming, 'More cosmopolitan, Pumptini!,' a drink my colleague at Kotaku Alyssa Mercante referred to as 'cotton candy gasoline.' So it goes.\n\nBoth James and Tom Schwartz feel betrayed by Sandoval: James because one-half of Scandoval featured his ex-fiancée, and Schwartz because Sandoval kinda-sorta left their business high and dry in the wake of the scandal. James’ new girlfriend Ally apparently runs an astrology business now (she’s a Capricorn sun, Libra moon, Pisces rising, in case you were wondering) and invites Schwartz over to read his birth chart. 'To put it nicely, I feel like he could just use a little direction,' she says in a confessional, putting it as nicely as anyone can. Schwartz is divorced, was a homeowner for about a year, and has two troubled businesses because his partner couldn’t keep it in his pants. But he’s such a Libra, he’s not good with conflict. Ack!\n\nThe episode ends with Sandoval successfully having an over-by-midnight small gathering. He apparently managed to round up 12 friends (including former Sur employee Billie Lee!) for this event. James shows up (while Ally, also being such a Libra, stays in car) and tells Sandoval that he feels betrayed. We end on a 'To Be Continued...' that feels less like a cliffhanger and more like we just ran out of time for resolution.\n\n\nOn that note, Scheana Shay’s storyline revolves around 1. working up the nerve post-partum to be able to leave her daughter alone with a close friend and 2. recording an emo version of her Platinum (on my cardio playlist) hit 'Good As Gold.' We don’t really get payoff on either of these things, but there is more on the horizon.

The Jets drafted him No. 3 overall and he spoke about ending the Jets’ title drought, but he was traded after three disappointing seasons. Now, he’s Brock Purdy’s backup with the 49ers and he is preparing for Super Bowl 2024.\n\n“Obviously, I wish things would have gone different. … I wish we would have won more, obviously,” Darnold said Monday about his time with the Jets.\n\nDarnold experienced three losing seasons with the Jets.\n\nHe was traded in 2021 to the Panthers when the Jets decided to move on and draft Zach Wilson.\n\nAfter two years with the Panthers, he signed with the 49ers this offseason to be a backup.\n\nWhile Darnold’s time with the Jets is remembered for more bad than good, he said he still looks back fondly at his Jets days.\n\n“Obviously, it was an experience that I’ll never ever take for granted,” Darnold said. “To be able to go through the ups, go through the downs with that organization and with those coaches, with those guys, you tend to remember most of the good moments that you have. Obviously, a lot of people can bring up some of the bad ones sometimes.”\n\nHe thought he would be the one to put a second Lombardi Trophy in the Jets’ trophy case.\n\n“I always envisioned going deep in the playoffs with New York and being able to make a run at the Super Bowl,” Darnold said. “Obviously, that’s what you dream of as a kid. Right when I got drafted by the Jets, and still to this day it’s my goal to be able to bring a championship somewhere. At the same time, you kind of understand what it takes, even in the backup role like I am right now you understand what it takes to actually make it here and actually get it done and not just dream of it and envision it. It’s a lot of hard work, a lot of sacrifice.”\n\nDarnold will be a free agent in a month. He said he still wants to be a starter but he is valuing his time helping the 49ers try to win a title.\n\nThis week, that means mimicking Patrick Mahomes in practice.\n\n“As a competitor, you always want to play football,” Darnold said. “Obviously, there are different ways to be able to help the team. During the week, I play scout team and try to get the defense ready for Pat Mahomes and everything that Chiefs offense does. That part is fun for me.”\n\n“Obviously, we want Brock to stay healthy and stay on the field,” Darnold said, “but if my time does come, I’m very confident in myself to be able to go out there and do my job.”", "created_on": "2024-02-08T02:10:51.709Z", "status": 1, "source_id": "nypost", "source_priority": 109, "country": "", "category": "s,p,o,r,t,s", "language": "english", "pub_date": "2024-02-07T14:10:00Z", "image_url": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/newspress-collage-rpjd6wuxk-1707314118000.jpg?quality=90&strip=all"}}, {"model": "qfb_main.newsarticle", "pk": 3, "fields": {"title": "Nvidia Blackwell: What we expect and what we want to see from Nvidia's next-gen GeForce GPUs", "slug": "nvidia-blackwell-what-we-expect-and-what-we-want-to-see-from-nvidias-next-gen-geforce-gpus-a0689f33", "author": 1, "excerpt": "", "updated_on": "2024-02-08T04:47:01.849Z", "content": "Rumour and speculation is running riot for Nvidia's next generation of GPUs, so here's everything we hope and expect from Nvidia's next graphics cards.\n\nNothing stirs up the internet rumour mill quite like the speculation around a new generation of graphics cards, and Nvidia's next generation GPU architecture, believed to be codenamed Blackwell, is currently the source of much debate in the PC hardware world.\n\nWhile we'll likely have to wait a little while longer before anything official is revealed about Nvidia's next generation of GPUs, we decided to take the opportunity to round up some of the more credible rumours we've heard so far and discuss our expectations, wants and desires for the new cards.\n\nIt seems like it wasn't that long ago we were sorting through the rumoured specs of the Ada Lovelace generation of graphics cards, and to be quite honest, it wasn't. A quick look back to early 2022 finds us speculating on some of the potential power requirements of Nvidia's next generation flagship, the card that eventually turned out to be the RTX 4090, and a possible max TDP of 800W or more. \n\n\nThankfully when the RTX 4090 did eventually arrive it wasn't even close to that level of power draw, but with a TGP of 450W it was still surprisingly thirsty. A handy reminder then, that while speculation of this type can (and often does) end up being off the mark, a grain of truth can often be found.\n\n\nWhile we know little about Blackwell gaming GPUs so far, we do know that the B100 Blackwell graphics processor for enterprise computing will be released in 2024, based on official Nvidia slides shown at the SuperComputing 2023 special address (via Wccftech). The teaser slides showed the GPU almost doubling the performance of the Hopper H200 it will replace in the GPT-3 175B inference performance benchmark.\n\nNvidia has remained typically tight-lipped about it's next-gen gaming GPUs, although given what we have so far, it's still possible to gain a decent idea as to where it might be heading with the next generation of cards.\n\nSo what can we expect, and what do we want in the next generation of Nvidia GPUs?\n\nWhat naming scheme can we expect for Nvidia Blackwell?\nThe previous Nvidia graphics processor generation was named Ada Lovelace, after the English mathematician and writer who worked extensively on Charles Babbage's mechanical computer, the Analytical Engine. This new generation of processors is rumoured to be named \"Blackwell\" after David Blackwell, an American mathematician who made significant contributions to game theory, probability theory, information theory and statistics.\n\nThe RTX 4090 was based on the Ada Lovelace AD102 graphics processor, and was later followed by the RTX 4080, based on the AD103, and the RTX 4070 based on the AD104, before being followed by the RTX 4060 and RTX 4060 Ti variations using AD107 and AD106 respectively. \n\nAccording to known Nvidia leaker kopite7kimi, the new generation of GPUs will use the GB prefix, and will reportedly be led by the GB202 as presumably the flagship card, then followed by the GB203, GB205 and GB206, with the entry level card being the GB207, much like the RTX 4060 with its AD107 designation. \n\nIf this naming scheme is accurate, the surprise here would be the move away from the 04 designation, with it's presumed replacement being the 05, although whether that's how things end up stacking up in terms of the eventual product line up is still to be confirmed. Nvidia currently lines up its GPUs by performance and not by the chip, so whether we'll see some changes in the last two digits of the product names to reflect this is still unclear, but seems unlikely.\n\n\nWhat of the GB100, though, why are we starting with the 200s? Well, Nvidia isn't. The reason we're relatively confident about the Blackwell architecture is that it's already been teased by Nvidia as the name for its next-gen AI and supercomputing parts with B100 and the GB100 being used for its professional graphics cards. \n\n\nIt is worth noting that in recent history Nvidia has sometimes disaggregated its enterprise, compute-focused architecture from it gaming GPUs. We've never seen either the Volta or Hopper architectures used in consumer graphics cards, though it did use both Pascal and Ampere architectures in enterprise.\n\n\nRegardless, we expect that what we'll end up seeing on the shelves is likely to be called the RTX 50-series, given the steady one-digit increase in the first number of Nvidia GPU product generations previous, i.e. the RTX 30-series to 40-series, and that the tried and tested -080, -070 and -060 designations will be used once again.\n\n\nAfter all, if it 'aint broke don't fix it, although it's not like that's ever stopped anyone's marketing departments before...", "created_on": "2024-02-08T02:10:51.918Z", "status": 1, "source_id": "pcgamer", "source_priority": 571, "country": "", "category": "t,e,c,h,n,o,l,o,g,y", "language": "english", "pub_date": "2024-02-07T14:09:59Z", "image_url": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mKHFzWW5AJFoGjVmZC2yzi.jpg"}}, {"model": "qfb_main.newsarticle", "pk": 4, "fields": {"title": "Prudential appoints new Group Insurance president", "slug": "prudential-appoints-new-group-insurance-president-8c825b3d", "author": 1, "excerpt": "", "updated_on": "2024-02-08T04:47:01.982Z", "content": "NEWARK, N.J. - Prudential Financial, Inc.

We’ve built ourselves a strong platform to add performance when we can and we have set ourselves targets to deliver those.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘We’ve got some big ideas’ – After a turbulent 2023, tech chief Matt Harman explains Alpine’s plan to turn it around this year\n\n“We have pushed some elements to the limit and, in some cases, beyond that.

The display is approximately 27.5 millimeters by 24 millimeters.\"\n\n\"Divide the dimensions by [the pixel size], and we find the lit area to be about 3,660 pixels by 3,200 pixels, equating to 12.1 million lit pixels, give or take a few,\" says iFixit. \"These values don't fulfill the 4K definition by commercial standards — but neither do 4K TVs.\"\n\nTelevisions with 4K typically have displays that are 3840 x 2160 pixels, so the Apple Vision Pro is close in one dimension and exceeds 4K in the other.\n\nUltimately, the firm calculated that the Apple Vision Pro displays are about 3,380 pixels per inch.\n\n\"You can fit 50 of these pixels in a single iPhone pixel,\" says the firm. \"[Then] 170 of these pixels would fit in a 12.9-inch iPad Pro pixel, and 2,500 of these pixels would fit in a single 65-inch 4K TV.\"\n\nHowever, iFixit argues that what matters more is the number of pixels per degree (PPD), the \"number of observable pixels per degree of vision.\"\n\n\"We've calculated that the Apple Vision Pro has an average PPD of somewhere around 34 pixels, based on a field of view of 100 degrees,\" says the firm, \"which appears to be accurate when measured against the Quest 3 in a very rudimentary test.\"\n\n\"When compared to the Quest 3, the Apple Vision Pro's field of view is slightly narrower,\" it continues, \"but the image quality is markedly higher.\"\n\nFor this teardown, iFixit also examined the Apple Vision Pro battery, which it describes as simple \"but over-engineered.\" It consists of three 15.36 watt-hours iPhone-sized batteries in a stack.\n\nThree of those would suggest 46.08 watt-hours overall, but the battery description says 35.9 watt-hours. \"At first glance, this looks like Apple's undershooting the watt-hour rating by over 20%,\" says iFixit. \"There's a chance they're purposely undercharging the cells in this pack, the same reason they just released an 80% charge limit for the [iPhone] 15 Pro.\"\n\n\"The [battery] pack is also outputting more voltage than a normal USB-C pack to keep up with the Vision Pro's high processing demands,\" continues the company, \"which is why they use the bespoke big lightning cable, so you don't accidentally plug other devices in and fry them.\"\n\nTo calculate its final repairability score of 4 out of 10, iFixit notes that the battery pack can't be opened without damage. Elements of the headset itself, though, are modular and so replaceable.", "created_on": "2024-02-08T02:10:52.539Z", "status": 1, "source_id": "appleinsider", "source_priority": 3027, "country": "", "category": "t,e,c,h,n,o,l,o,g,y", "language": "english", "pub_date": "2024-02-07T14:09:25Z", "image_url": "https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/58501-119203-000-lead-Apple-Vision-Pro-iFixit-xl.jpg"}}, {"model": "qfb_main.newsarticle", "pk": 7, "fields": {"title": "Gina Carano’s Disney The Mandalorian Firing Lawsuit: Is Elon Musk Funding It?", "slug": "gina-caranos-disney-the-mandalorian-firing-lawsuit-is-elon-musk-funding-it-e69ccbc2", "author": 1, "excerpt": "", "updated_on": "2024-02-08T04:47:02.375Z", "content": "Actress Gina Carano is suing Disney over being dropped from “The Mandalorian” television series in 2021 — a lawsuit funded by Elon Musk, who has taken swipes at the conglomerate since it withdrew advertising dollars last year from the social media platform he owns.\n\nMusk, who purchased Twitter in October 2022 with the intention of transforming it into a town square of unpoliced free speech, has promised to fund lawsuits for people “unfairly treated” by their employers over their posts or activity on the platform, which he has rebranded as X.\n\nHe reiterated that promise Tuesday after Carano filed a lawsuit financed by X against Disney and its subsidiary, Lucasfilm, in which she asked for damages and for her role to be reinstated on the Emmy-winning TV show.\n\nCarano played Cara Dune in “The Mandalorian,” an addition to the Star Wars franchise that premiered in November 2019. A former mixed martial artist, she initially drew positive reviews. But controversy over her social media activity culminated in a decision to drop her from the show in February 2021 after she posted an Instagram story that was taken by many critics as a comparison between having right-wing views and being a Jew during the Holocaust.\n\nGina Carano is off ‘The Mandalorian’ over ‘abhorrent and unacceptable’ social media posts, Lucasfilm says\n\nBacklash against the post sparked the trending hashtag #FireGinaCarano on what was then Twitter. In a statement at the time, Lucasfilm said that Carano’s “social media posts denigrating people based on their cultural and religious identities are abhorrent and unacceptable,” and that there were no plans to employ her.\n\nOn Tuesday, Carano denied making the comparison. The text from her Instagram story, which was later deleted, was accompanied by a disturbing Nazi-era photo and argued that before “soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews, the government first made their own neighbors hate them simply for being Jews. How is that any different from hating someone for their political views?”\n\nIn the lawsuit, Carano’s attorneys allege that she was fired in retaliation for the “lawful exercise of her right to speak and express her views.” She was previously criticized for social media activity that included liking posts that disparaged the Black Lives Matter movement, mocking coronavirus mask-wearing as a Democratic Party conspiracy and echoing former president Donald Trump’s baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election.\n\nIn a Tuesday statement on X, Carano said she was “being hunted down” online because her views were not “in line with the acceptable narrative of the time.” She said a lawyer hired by X contacted her after she responded to Musk’s offer to fund legal representation.", "created_on": "2024-02-08T02:10:52.745Z", "status": 1, "source_id": "comingsoon", "source_priority": 3031, "country": "", "category": "e,n,t,e,r,t,a,i,n,m,e,n,t", "language": "english", "pub_date": "2024-02-07T14:09:25Z", "image_url": "https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/gina-carano-disney-mandalorian-lawsuit-explained-elon-musk-funding.jpg?w=1024"}}, {"model": "qfb_main.newsarticle", "pk": 8, "fields": {"title": "A Quiet Place: Day One Trailer Previews the Intense Prequel", "slug": "a-quiet-place-day-one-trailer-previews-the-intense-prequel-6aa8da32", "author": 1, "excerpt": "", "updated_on": "2024-02-08T04:47:02.505Z", "content": "The first A Quiet Place: Day One trailer has been released, showing off the fearsome prequel set in the world of A Quiet Place.
