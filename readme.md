## Development Challenges

During development, I encountered several challenges that required creative solutions:

- **Form Validation Issues**: Initially, the comment form was submitting even when some fields were left empty. Implementing client-side validation using JavaScript ensured all required information was provided before submission.

- **Missing Fields in Form**: After adding "Name" and "Email" fields, the form data sent to the server did not include this information. Adjusting the JavaScript code handling form submission to include these values solved the issue.

- **Text Formatting in Articles**: The news articles fetched from the API appeared as a single text block. Implementing a text processing step to format this content into readable paragraphs improved user experience.
